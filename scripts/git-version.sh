# The single definition of the version of the three packages this repository
# builds: the most recent `v*` git tag. Copied from triald's, which is the
# family's; the rules are the same in every braemons repository.
#
# Deliberately has no fallback. A wrong-but-plausible version silently baked
# into a package is worse than a failed build, so the only two ways to get a
# version are a reachable tag or an explicit RIG_VERSION.
#
# Output is normalised for dpkg and rpm, both of which reject '-' inside a
# version and both of which sort '~' *before* the empty string:
#
#   v0.1.0                    -> 0.1.0
#   v0.1.0-alpha4             -> 0.1.0~alpha4          (sorts before 0.1.0)
#   v0.1.0-alpha4-2-gabc123   -> 0.1.0~alpha4+2.gabc123 (sorts after the tag)
#   ...with uncommitted changes appending +dirty
#
# `--pep440` prints the same version with the '~' dropped, which pip
# normalises (0.1.0alpha4 -> 0.1.0a4).

# once '-' is ruled out: dpkg additionally requires a leading digit, and rpm
# rejects the '-' that dpkg permits only as the revision separator. Underscores
# and '^' are each legal in exactly one of the two, so both are excluded.

# $2 is what the value was derived from, for the error message.
